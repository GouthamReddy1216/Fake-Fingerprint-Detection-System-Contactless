# Fake-Fingerprint-Detection-System-Contactless-
- **Objective:** Detect attempts to deceive fingerprint recognition systems through the use of fake or synthetic fingerprints.

- **Abstract**: Contactless fingerprint identification systems have been introduced to address the deficiencies of contact-based fingerprint systems. A number of studies have been reported regarding contactless fingerprint processing, including classical image processing, the machine-learning
pipeline, and a number of deep-learning-based algorithms. The deep-learning-based methods were
reported to have higher accuracies than their counterparts.

- **Methodology:** Analyze unique characteristics of contactless fingerprint images and employ sophisticated algorithms.

- **Technology Focus:** Specifically designed for identifying presentation attacks involving artificial means, such as printed or molded replicas.

- **Benefits:** Enhances the security of biometric authentication systems by ensuring the authenticity of fingerprint samples.
